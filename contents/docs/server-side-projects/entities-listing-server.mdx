# Entities Listing Server Documentation

The Entities Listing Server is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, designed for managing and fetching account data for people and businesses. This server, called `entities-listing-server`, allows users to create, read, update, and delete their account data, while public users can view publicly accessible information about registered entities.

## Overview

**This server supports**:

1. **User Account Management**: Allows individuals and businesses to create accounts.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Registered users can perform full CRUD operations on their own accounts.
3. **Public Access to Data**: Public users can fetch selected data about registered users and businesses.
4. **Data Security**: User information is secured by JWT authentication for protected routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can modify their own data.

## Schema

The following data structure is stored for each user:

```javascript
{
  email: String,         // User's unique email address
  password: String,      // Encrypted password
  name: String,          // First name
  surname: String,       // Last name
  age: Number,           // Age of the user
  username: String,      // Unique username
  instagram: String,     // Instagram handle
  linkedin: String,      // LinkedIn handle
  whatsapp: String,      // WhatsApp contact link
  twitter: String,       // Twitter handle
  mobile: String,        // Mobile number
  race: String,          // Race/ethnicity
  banner: String,        // Banner image URL
  image: String,         // Profile image URL
  address: String,       // Street address
  state: String,         // State of residence
  region: String,        // Regional location
  country: String,       // Country of residence
  gender: String,        // Gender identity
  city: String,          // City of residence
  generation: String,    // Generational identity
  description: String,   // Brief user bio/description
  postal_code: String,   // Postal code
  profession: String     // User's profession
}
```

Each document also includes automatically generated timestamps: `createdAt` and `updatedAt`.

## API Endpoints

The server exposes the following endpoints:

### Public Endpoints

**GET /entities**
Fetches a list of all public entity data (with optional filters).

**GET /entities/`id`**

Fetches detailed information for a specific entity by ID.

### Protected Endpoints (Authentication required)

**POST /entities/register**
Allows a new user or business to create an account. Requires email and password fields as mandatory data.

**PUT /entities/`:id`**

Updates account information for the authenticated user. The user must match the id provided in the request.

**DELETE /entities/`:id`**

Deletes the authenticated user's account. The user must match the id provided in the request.

## Authentication Middleware

The server uses JWT authentication to protect routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can modify their own data. Access tokens must be provided in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.

## Data Validation & Security

1. **Email Validation**: Ensures a valid and unique email address.
2. **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed before storage for enhanced security.
3. **Input Validation**: Input validation is enforced using libraries like `validator` to ensure data consistency and validity.

## Setting Up

### 1. Prerequisites

**Node.js (v14+)**
**MongoDB database (local or cloud-based)**

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and define the following:

```bash
PORT=5000                // Port the server will run on
MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
```

### 3. Running the Server

After cloning the repository and setting up the environment variables:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:<PORT>`.

## Usage Example

Hereâ€™s an example of creating a new account:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/entities \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "email": "testuser@example.com",
        "password": "Password*123",
        "name": "Test",
        "surname": "User",
        "profession": "Software Developer"
      }'
```

Response:

```bash
{
  "message": "Account created successfully",
  "data": {
    "_id": "606d5e7a1c2d4b0f2d1c9e0b",
    "email": "testuser@example.com",
    "name": "Test",
    "surname": "User",
    "profession": "Software Developer",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Additional Notes

**JWT Expiry**: Tokens expire in 3 days for security purposes.
**CORS**: Configured to allow requests from specific origins.
**Data Encryption**: Sensitive data, such as passwords, is hashed for security.

This API provides a secure and flexible solution for managing public and private data for users and businesses, making it suitable for social networks, professional listings, and business directories.
