From a foundational interest in technology to hands-on experience across diverse roles in web development and IT, my career has been a continuous journey of growth, adaptability, and innovation. Starting from self-driven projects to leading critical operations in a professional setting, I have developed a unique blend of technical expertise and problem-solving skills.

Each position I've held has not only deepened my knowledge but also challenged me to step up, adapt, and add value across multiple disciplines. The following experiences reflect my commitment to leveraging technology to create impactful solutions and my readiness to contribute meaningfully to future endeavors.

## Early Foundations and Education

With a foundational background in accounting and economics, my journey began with a genuine passion for technology and innovation. As a high school student, I was driven by a desire to create solutions, often sketching out program ideas and imagining how they could impact the world. To realize these ambitions, I pursued a degree in Computer Science at the University of the People, which laid the groundwork in programming principles.

Eventually, my educational path took a turn towards independent learning, allowing me the flexibility to explore modern development frameworks and tools, particularly React, which I found intuitive and approachable.

## Freelance Web Development and Entrepreneurial Ventures

Equipped with skills in React, Firebase, and Firestore, I delved into freelancing. These initial projects, though modest, provided a practical understanding of coding and real-world applications. I expanded my technical repertoire by incorporating WordPress and HTML, which allowed me to offer flexible solutions to clients. These projects honed my ability to deliver web solutions, while I balanced freelance work with a day job, growing both my entrepreneurial spirit and technical skills.

## Web Developer – Diverse IT Responsibilities

My first formal position as a Web Developer marked a pivotal point in my career. Working in a small company, I quickly found myself taking on roles far beyond typical development responsibilities. I became proficient in full-stack development and utilized CMS platforms and AI tools for prompt engineering, enabling me to manage duties typically handled by multiple team members, such as software engineering, webmaster tasks, content creation, and IT support.

To improve efficiency, I established agile development pipelines, created CRM systems hosted on-premises, and introduced streamlined workflows, all of which minimized operational costs. As the company scaled its client base, I became instrumental in developing cost-effective solutions for a growing workload.

## Senior Web Developer – Expanding Technical Expertise

My commitment to the company saw me grow into a senior role, overseeing the Server Management and Marketing & Content Creation departments. I expanded my technical expertise by learning PHP and MySQL, building on my MERN Stack knowledge, and integrating Node.js and MongoDB for more versatile applications.

Fascinated by Linux-based servers, I managed and monitored these servers to ensure high availability (99.99% uptime), resulting in substantial cost reductions. My role further encompassed SEO strategies, where I used cost-efficient tools to optimize search engine rankings.

## Leadership, Mentorship, and Continuous Growth

In my senior position, I trained new interns and supervised operations across departments to ensure optimal performance. My continuous learning and adaptability have been instrumental in my professional growth. Currently, I am focused on refining my skills in software development, server management, and cost-effective operational strategies, driven by a passion for technical excellence and effective problem-solving.
